# Contributing to HomeTrack

First off, thank you for considering contributing to HomeTrack! It's people like you that make HomeTrack such a great tool.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into HomeTrack itself.

### Reporting Bugs

*   **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/HomeTrack/issues).
*   If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/HomeTrack/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample or an executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
*   For GUI related bugs, please include screenshots and/or animated GIFs.

### Suggesting Enhancements

*   Open a new issue to start a discussion about your idea. This is a good way to get feedback before starting development.
*   Clearly describe the enhancement and the motivation for it.

### Pull Requests

We actively welcome your pull requests.

1.  **Fork the repo** and create your branch from `main` (or `develop` if that's your primary development branch).
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4.  Ensure the test suite passes.
5.  Make sure your code lints (if you have linters set up).
6.  Issue that pull request!

#### Pull Request Guidelines

*   Keep your PR focused on a single change or feature.
*   Provide a clear description of the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
*   Follow the coding style of the project. (You might want to add a section on coding style if you have specific rules).
*   Make sure all new and existing tests pass.
